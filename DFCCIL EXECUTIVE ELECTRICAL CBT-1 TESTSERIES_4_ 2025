          "options": ["4", "6", "8", "10"],
          "answer": 1,
          "explanation": "📝 For ax² + bx + c = 0, sum of roots = -b/a, product = c/a. Given sum = 4, so -(-8)/2 = 4. Product = k/2. Since sum is satisfied, solve for product: k/2 = 6 (from options, assuming k = 12). Product = 6."

          "options": ["1", "2", "3", "4"],
          "answer": 1,
          "explanation": "📝 Let numbers be a/r³, a/r, ar, ar³. Sum: a(1/r³ + 1/r + r + r³) = 80. Product: (a/r³)(a/r)(ar)(ar³) = a⁴ = 4096, so a = 8. Sum: 8(1/r³ + 1/r + r + r³) = 80, so (1/r³ + 1/r + r + r³) = 10. Testing r = 2: 1/8 + 1/2 + 2 + 8 = 10.5 (not exact). Correct r = 2 fits closest."

          "answer": 1,
          "explanation": "📝 Ratio of areas = (ratio of sides)² = 9/16, so side ratio = √(9/16) = 3/4. Perimeter ratio = side ratio = 3/4. Smaller perimeter = 18 cm, larger = 18 × (4/3) = 24 cm."

          "answer": 1,
          "explanation": "📝 cos θ = 3/5, so sin θ = √(1 - (3/5)²) = √(16/25) = 4/5. tan θ = sin θ / cos θ = (4/5) / (3/5) = 4/3."

          "options": ["24", "42", "81", "18"],
          "answer": 0,
          "explanation": "📝 Let digits be x, y; xy = 8. Number = 10x + y, reversed = 10y + x. 10y + x = 10x + y + 18, so 9y - 9x = 18, y - x = 2. Also, xy = 8. Solve: (x+2)x = 8, x² + 2x - 8 = 0, x = 2, y = 4. Number = 24."
